# dwm-tools
A set of customizations of dwm and dmenu

# Notes

For a few years, I ran Ubuntu Linux as my full time OS (on a wonderful Thinkpad X220 IPS).
To simplifiy window management, I ran a combination of [dwm](http://dwm.suckless.org/) and
[dmenu](http://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/). If you've used those tools before, you know that
they're usually customized by editing the source code directly.  This project contains my
customized versions of both, as well as various scripts for managing the display and keyboard
on my laptop. I never did get this to run perfectly, but it did run well enough, and was definately
more productive than the alternatives.
